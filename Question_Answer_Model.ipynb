We see the next five years as a unique opportunity to \\nrealize ‘Sabka Vikas’, stimulating balanced growth of all regions. \\n5. The great Telugu poet and playwright Gurajada Appa Rao had said, \\n‘Desamante Matti Kaadoi, Desamante Manushuloi’; meaning, ‘A country is not \\njust its soil, a country is its people.’ In line with this, for us, Viksit Bharat, \\nencompasses: \\na) zero-poverty; \\nb) hundred per cent good quality school education;   \\nc) access to high-quality, affordable, and comprehensive healthcare; \\nd) hundred per cent skilled labour with meaningful employment; \\ne) seventy per cent women in economic activities; and \\nf) farmers making our country the ‘food basket of the world’.  \\n6.

The domains are:  \\n1) Taxation; \\n2) Power Sector; \\n3) Urban Development; \\n4) Mining; \\n5) Financial Sector; and \\n6) Regulatory Reforms. \\nAgriculture as the 1st Engine \\n9. Now I move to specific proposals, beginning with ‘Agriculture as the 1st \\nEngine’.  \\nPrime Minister Dhan -Dhaanya Krishi Yojana - Developing Agri Districts \\nProgramme \\n10. Motivated by the success of the Aspirational Districts Programme, our \\nGovernment will undertake a ‘Prime Minister Dhan -Dhaanya Krishi Yojana’ in \\npartnership with states. Through the convergence of existing schemes and \\nspecialized measures, the programme will cover 100 districts with low \\nproductivity, moderate crop intensity and below-average credit parameters. It \\naims to (1) enhance agricultural productivity, (2) adopt crop diversification and \\nsustainable agriculture practices, (3) augment post -harvest stor age at the \\npanchayat and block level, (4) improve irrigation facilities, and (5) facilitate \\navailability of long-term and short-term credit. This programme is likely to help \\n1.7 crore farmers. \\nBuilding Rural Prosperity and Resilience \\n11. A comprehensive multi -sectoral ‘Rural Prosperity and Resilience’ \\nprogramme will be launched in partnership with states. This will address under-\\nemployment in agriculture through skilling, investment, technology, and \\ninvigorating the rural economy. The goal is to generate ample opportunities in \\nrural areas so that migration is an option, but not a necessity.  \\n12. The programme will focus on rural women, young farmers, rural youth, \\nmarginal and small farmers, and landless families. Details are in Annexure A.'),\n",

Global and domestic best practices will be incorporated and \\nappropriate technical and financial assistance will be sought from multilateral \\ndevelopment banks. In Phase-1, 100 developing agri-districts will be covered.   \\nAatmanirbharta in Pulses    \\n14. Our Government is implementing the National Mission for Edible \\nOilseed for achieving atmanirbhrata in edible oils. Our farmers have the \\ncapability to grow enough for our needs and more.  \\n15. Ten years ago, we made concerted efforts and succeeded in achieving \\nnear self-sufficiency in pulses. Farmers responded to the need by increasing the \\ncultivated area by 50 per cent and Government arranged for procurement and \\nremunerative prices. Since then, with rising incomes and better affordability, \\nour consumption of pulses has increased significantly.  \\n16. Our Government will now launch a 6-year “Mission for Aatmanirbharta \\nin Pulses” with a special focus on Tur, Urad and Masoor.  Details are in \\nAnnexure B. Central agencies (NAFED and NCCF) will be ready to procure these \\n3 pulses, as much as offered during the next 4 years from farmers who register \\nwith these agencies and enter into agreements.   \\nComprehensive Programme for Vegetables & Fruits \\n17. It is encouraging that our people are increasingly becoming aware of \\ntheir nutritional needs. It is a sign of a society becoming healthier. With rising \\nincome levels, the consumption of vegetables, fruits and shree -anna is \\nincreasing significantly. A comprehensive programme to promote production, \\nefficient supplies, processing, and remunerative prices for farmers will be \\nlaunched in partnership with states. Appropriate institutional mechanisms for \\nimplementation and participation of farmer producer organiza tions and \\ncooperatives will be set up.   \\nMakhana Board in Bihar \\n18. For this, there is a special opportunity for the people of Bihar. A \\nMakhana Board will be established in the state to improve production, \\nprocessing, value addition, and marketing of makhana. The people engaged in \\nthese activities will be organized into FPOs. The Board will provide handholding \\nand training support to makhana farmers and will also work to ensure they \\nreceive the benefits of all relevant Government schemes.'),\n",

A National Mission on High Yielding Seeds will be launched, aimed at (1) \\nstrengthening the research ecosystem, (2) targeted development and \\npropagation of seeds with high yield, pest resistance and climate resilience, and \\n(3) commercial availability of more than 100 seed varieties released since July \\n2024.  \\nFisheries \\n20. India ranks second-largest globally in fish production and aquaculture. \\nSeafood exports are valued at ` 60 thousand crore. To unlock the untapped \\npotential of the marine sector, our Government will bring in an enabling \\nframework for sustainable harnessing of fisheries from Indian Exclusive \\nEconomic Zone and High Seas, with a special focus on the Andaman & Nicobar \\nand Lakshadweep Islands.  \\nMission for Cotton Productivity \\n21. For the benefit of lakhs of cotton growing farmers, I am pleased to \\nannounce a ‘Mission for Cotton Productivity’. This 5-year mission will facilitate \\nsignificant improvements in productivity and sustainability of cotton farming, \\nand promote extra -long stap le cotton varieties. The best of science & \\ntechnology support will be provided to farmers. Aligned with our integrated 5F \\nvision for the textile sector, this will help in increasing incomes of the farmers, \\nand ensure a steady supply of quality cotton for rejuvenating India’s traditional \\ntextile sector.  \\nEnhanced Credit through KCC \\n22. Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) facilitate short term loans for 7.7 crore farmers, \\nfishermen, and dairy farmers. The loan limit under the Modified Interest \\nSubvention Scheme will be enhanced from ` 3 lakh to 5 lakh for loans taken \\nthrough the KCC.   \\nUrea Plant in Assam \\n23. For Atmanirbharta in urea production, our Government had reopened \\nthree dormant urea plants in the Eastern region. To further augment urea \\nsupply, a plant with annual capacity of 12.7 lakh metric tons will be set up at \\nNamrup, Assam. \\nIndia Post as a Catalyst for the Rural Economy \\n24.

Our Government will provide support to NCDC for its lending operations \\nfor the cooperative sector. \\nMSMEs as the 2nd engine \\n27. Now, I move to MSMEs as the 2 nd engine, which encompasses \\nmanufacturing and services with a focus on MSMEs numbering 5.7 crore. \\nRevision in classification criteria for MSMEs \\n28. Currently, over 1 crore registered MSMEs, employing 7.5 crore people, \\nand generating 36 per cent of our manufacturing, have come together to \\nposition India as a global manufacturing hub. With their quality products, \\nthese MSMEs are responsible for 45 per c ent of our exports. To help them \\nachieve higher efficiencies of scale, technological upgradation and better \\naccess to capital, the investment and turnover limits for classification of all \\nMSMEs will be enhanced to 2.5 and 2 times respectively. This will gi ve them \\nthe confidence to grow and generate employment for our youth. The details \\nare in Annexure D.  \\nSignificant enhancement of credit availability with guarantee cover \\n29. To improve access to credit, the credit guarantee cover will be \\nenhanced: \\na) For Micro and Small Enterprises, from ` 5 crore to 10 crore, leading \\nto additional credit of ` 1.5 lakh crore in the next 5 years;  \\nb) For Startups, from ` 10 crore to 20 crore, with the guarantee fee \\nbeing moderated to 1 per cent for loans in 27 focus sectors \\nimportant for Atmanirbhar Bharat; and \\nc) For well-run exporter MSMEs, for term loans up to ` 20 crore. \\nCredit Cards for Micro Enterprises \\n30.

These will also support domestic manufacturing and \\nvalue addition, promote exports, facilitate trade and provide relief to common \\npeople.  \\nRationalisation of Customs Tariff Structure for Industrial Goods \\n116. As a part of comprehensive review of Customs rate structure \\nannounced in July 2024 Budget, I propose to: \\n(i) remove seven tariff rates. This is over and above the seven tariff \\nrates removed in 2023-24 budget. After this, there will be only eight \\nremaining tariff rates including ‘zero’ rate.  \\n(ii) apply appropriate cess to broadly maintain effective duty incidence \\nexcept on a few items, where such incidence will reduce marginally.  \\n(iii) levy not more than one cess or surcharge. Therefore, I propose to \\nexempt Social Welfare Surcharge on 82 tariff lines that are subject \\nto a cess. \\n117. I shall now take up sector specific proposals. \\nRelief on import of Drugs/Medicines  \\n118.  To provide relief to patients, particularly those suffering from cancer, \\nrare diseases and other severe chronic diseases, I propose to add 36 lifesaving \\ndrugs and medicines to the list of medicines fully exempted from Basic Customs \\nDuty (BCD).  I also pro pose to add 6 lifesaving medicines to the list attracting \\nconcessional customs duty of 5%. Full exemption and concessional duty will \\nalso respectively apply on the bulk drugs for manufacture of the above.  \\n119. Specified drugs and medicines under Patient Assistance Programmes \\nrun by pharmaceutical companies are fully exempt from BCD, provided the \\nmedicines are supplied free of cost to patients. I propose to add 37 more \\nmedicines along with 13 new patient assistance programmes.'),\n",

In the July 2024 Budget, I had fully exempted BCD on 25 critical minerals \\nthat are not domestically available. I had also reduced BCD of 2 other such \\nminerals to provide a major fillip to their processing especially by MSMEs. Now, \\nI propose to fully exempt  cobalt powder and waste, the scrap of lithium -ion \\nbattery, Lead, Zinc and 12 more critical minerals. This will help secure their \\navailability for manufacturing in India and promote more jobs for our youth.  \\nTextiles \\n121.  To promote domestic production of technical textile products such as \\nagro-textiles, medical textiles and geo textiles at competitive prices, I propose \\nto add two more types of shuttle-less looms to the list of fully exempted textile \\nmachinery.  I also propose to revise the BCD rate on knitted fabrics covered by \\nnine tariff lines from “10% or 20%” to “20% or ` 115 per kg, whichever is \\nhigher”. \\nElectronic Goods \\n122. In line with our ‘Make in India’ policy, and to rectify inverted duty \\nstructure, I propose to increase the BCD on Interactive Flat Panel Display (IFPD) \\nfrom 10% to 20% and reduce the BCD to 5% on Open Cell and other \\ncomponents.  \\n123. In 2023 -24 Budget, for the manufacture of Open Cells of LCD/LED TVs, \\nI had reduced the BCD on parts of Open Cells from 5% to 2.5% . To further boost \\nthe manufacture of such Open Cells, the BCD on these parts will now stand \\nexempted. \\nLithium Ion Battery \\n124. To the list of exempted capital goods, I propose to add 35 additional \\ncapital goods for EV battery manufacturing, and 28 additional capital goods for \\nmobile phone battery manufacturing. This will boost domestic manufacture of \\nlithium-ion battery, both for mobile phones and electric vehicles. \\nShipping Sector \\n125.  Considering that shipbuilding has a long gestation period, I propose to \\ncontinue the exemption of BCD on raw materials, components, consumables \\nor parts for the manufacture of ships for another ten years. I also propose the \\nsame dispensation for ship breaking to make it more competitive.'),\n",

To prevent classification disputes, I propose to reduce the BCD from \\n20% to 10% on Carrier Grade ethernet switches to make it at par with Non -\\nCarrier Grade ethernet switches. \\nExport Promotion \\nHandicraft Goods  \\n127.  To facilitate exports of handicrafts, I propose to extend the time period \\nfor export from six months to one year, further extendable by another three \\nmonths, if required. I also propose to add nine items to the list of duty -free \\ninputs. \\nLeather sector \\n128.   I propose to fully exempt BCD on Wet Blue leather to facilitate imports \\nfor domestic value addition and employment. I also propose to exempt crust \\nleather from 20% export duty to facilitate exports by small tanners.  \\nMarine products \\n129.  To enhance India's competitiveness in the global seafood market, I \\npropose to reduce BCD from 30% to 5% on  Frozen Fish Paste (Surimi) for \\nmanufacture and export of its analogue products. I also propose to reduce BCD \\nfrom 15% to 5% on fish hydrolysate for manufacture of fish and   shrimp feeds. \\nDomestic MROs for Railway Goods \\n130.  In July 2024 Budget, to promote development of domestic MROs for \\naircraft and ships, I had extended the time limit for export of foreign origin \\ngoods that were imported for repairs, from 6 months to one year and further \\nextendable by one year.  I now pro pose to extend the same dispensation for \\nrailway goods. \\n \\nTrade facilitation  \\nTime limit for Provisional Assessment \\n131.  Presently, the Customs Act, 1962 does not provide any time limit to \\nfinalize Provisional Assessments leading to uncertainty and cost to trade. As a \\nmeasure of promoting ease of doing business, I propose to fix a time -limit of \\ntwo years, extendable by a year, for finalising the provisional assessment.\"),\n",

I propose to introduce a new provision that will enable importers or \\nexporters, after clearance of goods, to voluntarily declare material facts and \\npay duty with interest but without penalty. This will incentivise voluntary \\ncompliance.  However, this wil l not apply in cases where department has \\nalready initiated audit or investigation proceedings. \\nExtended Time for End Use \\n133. For industry to better plan their imports, I propose to extend the time \\nlimit for the end-use of imported inputs in the relevant rules, from six months \\nto one year. This will provide operational flexibility in view of cost and \\nuncertainty of supply. Furth er, such importers will now have to file only \\nquarterly statements instead of a monthly statement.  \\n \\nDirect Taxes \\nI now come to my Direct tax proposals.  \\n134.  In Part A, I have briefly underlined Taxation Reforms as one of key \\nreforms to realize our vision of Viksit Bharat.  In respect of criminal law, Our \\nGovernment had earlier ushered in Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita replacing \\nBharatiya Danda Sanhita. I am happy to inform this August House and the \\ncountry that the new income -tax bill will carry forward the same spirit of \\n“Nyaya”. The new bill will be clear and direct in text with close to half of the \\npresent law, in terms of both chapters and words. It will be simple to \\nunderstand for taxpayers and tax administration, leading to tax certainty and \\nreduced litigation.   \\n135. Reforms, however, are not a destination. They are a means to achieve \\ngood governance for our people and economy. Providing good governance \\nprimarily involves being responsive. The Thirukkural captures this in Verse 542, \\nwhich reads: \\nவான ாக்கி வாழும் உலககல்லாம் ம ் வ ் \\nனகால்ன ாக்கி வாழுங் குடி. \\nvaanokki vaalum ulakellaam mannavan \\nkoalnokki vaalung kuti \\nMeaning:  \\nJust as living beings live expecting rains,  \\nCitizens live expecting good governance.'),\n",

The \\nfollowing measures will detail just how our Government under the guidance of \\nPM Modi has taken steps to understand and address the needs voiced by our \\ncitizens. My tax proposals are guided by this spirit.  \\n136. The objectives of my proposals are as follows: \\n(i) Personal Income Tax reforms with special focus on middle class  \\n(ii) Rationalization of TDS/TCS for easing difficulties \\n(iii) Encouraging voluntary compliance \\n(iv) Reducing compliance burden \\n(v) Ease of doing business \\n(vi) Employment and investment \\nI will come to my proposal on personal income tax towards the end. \\nTDS/TCS rationalization for easing difficulties \\n137. I propose to rationalize Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) by reducing the \\nnumber of rates and thresholds above which TDS is deducted. Further, \\nthreshold amounts for tax deduction will be increased for better clarity and \\nuniformity. The limit for tax deduction  on interest for senior citizens is being \\ndoubled from the present ` 50,000 to ` 1 lakh. Similarly, the annual limit of ` \\n2.40 lakh for TDS on rent is being increased to ` 6 lakh. This will reduce the \\nnumber of transactions liable to TDS, thus benefitting small tax payers \\nreceiving small payments. \\n138. The threshold to collect tax at source (TCS) on remittances under RBI’s \\nLiberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) is proposed to be increased from ` 7 lakh \\nto ` 10 lakh. I also propose to remove TCS on remittances for education \\npurposes, where such remittance is out of a loan taken from a specified \\nfinancial institution. \\n139. Both TDS and TCS are being applied on any transaction relating to sale \\nof goods. To prevent such compliance difficulties, I propose to omit the TCS. I \\nalso propose that the provisions of the higher TDS deduction will now apply \\nonly in non-PAN cases.'),\n",

In July 2024, the delay for payment of TDS up to the due date of filing \\nstatement was decriminalized. I propose to provide the same relaxation to TCS \\nprovisions as well.  \\nEncouraging Voluntary Compliance \\n141. The Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi believes \\nin “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas and Sabka Prayas”. In line with \\nthis, we brought in updated return facility in 2022 for voluntary compliance by \\ntaxpayers who had omitted to report their correct income. Our trust in \\ntaxpayers was proved right. Nearly 90 lakh taxpayers voluntarily updated their \\nincomes by paying addition al tax. Taking this trust further, I now propose to \\nextend the time-limit to file updated returns for any assessment year, from the \\ncurrent limit of two years, to four years.  \\nReducing Compliance Burden \\n142. I propose to reduce the compliance burden for small charitable \\ntrusts/institutions by increasing their period of registration from 5 years to 10 \\nyears. It is also proposed that disproportionate consequences do not arise for \\nminor defaults, such as incomplete applications filed by charitable entities. \\n143. Presently tax -payers can claim the annual value of self -occupied \\nproperties as nil only on the fulfilment of certain conditions. Considering the \\ndifficulties faced by taxpayers, it is proposed to allow the benefit of two such \\nself-occupied properties without any condition.  \\nEase of Doing Business  \\n144. To streamline the process of transfer pricing and to provide an \\nalternative to yearly examination, I propose to introduce a scheme for \\ndetermining arm's length price of international transaction for a block period \\nof three years. This will be in line with global best practices. \\n145. With a view to reduce litigation and provide certainty in international \\ntaxation, the scope of safe harbour rules is being expanded.    \\n146. A number of senior and very senior citizens have very old National \\nSavings Scheme accounts. As interest is no longer payable on such accounts, I \\npropose to exempt withdrawals made from NSS by individuals on or after the \\n29th of August, 2024. I am also prop osing to allow similar treatment to NPS \\nVatsalya accounts as is available to normal NPS accounts, subject to overall \\nlimits.\"),\n",

In my speech in July 2024, I had promised that all processes including \\ngiving effect to appellate orders shall be digitalized and made paper -less over \\nthe next two years. I am happy to announce that digitalization is being made \\noperational.  \\n148. In July 2024, we brought in the Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme to resolve \\nincome tax disputes pending in appeal. The scheme has received a great \\nresponse, with nearly 33,000 tax payers having availed of this scheme to settle \\ntheir disputes. \\nEmployment and Investment \\n149. I have a few proposals to promote investment and employment.  \\nTax certainty for electronics manufacturing Schemes \\n150. It is proposed to provide a presumptive taxation regime for non -\\nresidents who provide services to a resident company that is establishing or \\noperating an electronics manufacturing facility. I further propose to introduce \\na safe harbour for tax certainty fo r non-residents who store components for \\nsupply to specified electronics manufacturing units. \\nTonnage Tax Scheme for Inland Vessels \\n151. Presently the tonnage tax scheme is available to only sea going ships. \\nThe benefits of existing tonnage tax scheme are proposed to be extended to \\ninland vessels registered under the Indian Vessels Act, 2021 to promote inland \\nwater transport in the country. \\nExtension for incorporation of Start-Ups \\n152. We continue to support the Indian start -up eco-system. I propose to \\nextend the period of incorporation by 5 years to allow the benefit available to \\nstart-ups which are incorporated before 1.4.2030.  \\nInternational Financial Services Centre (IFSC) \\n153. In order to attract and promote additional activities in the IFSC, I am \\ninter alia proposing specific benefits to ship-leasing units, insurance offices and \\ntreasury centres of global companies which are set up in IFSC.  Further, to claim \\nbenefits, the cut-off date for commencement in IFSC has also been extended \\nby five years to 31.3.2030.'),\n",

To promote funding from Sovereign Wealth Funds and Pension Funds \\nto the infrastructure sector, I propose to extend the date of making an \\ninvestment by five more years, to 31st March, 2030.  \\nPersonal Income- tax Reforms with special focus on middle class \\n156. Democracy, Demography and Demand are the key support pillars in our \\njourney towards Viksit Bharat. The middle class provides strength for India’s \\ngrowth. This Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi has \\nalways believed in the admirable energy and ability of the middle class in \\nnation building. In recognition of their contribution, we have periodically \\nreduced their tax burden. Right after 2014, the ‘Nil tax ’ slab was raised to  \\n` 2.5 lakh, which was further raised to ` 5 lakh in 2019 and to ` 7 lakh in 2023. \\nThis is reflective of our Government’s trust on the middle-class tax payers. I am \\nnow happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable upto income \\nof ` 12 lakh (i.e. average income of ` 1 lakh per month other than special rate \\nincome such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be ` 12.75 \\nlakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of ` 75,000.  \\n157. Slabs and rates are being changed across the board to benefit all tax -\\npayers. The new structure will substantially reduce the taxes of the middle \\nclass and leave more money in their hands, boosting household consumption, \\nsavings and investment. \\n158.  In the new tax regime, I propose to revise tax rate structure as follows: \\n0-4 lakh rupees Nil \\n4-8 lakh rupees 5 per cent \\n8-12 lakh rupees 10 per cent \\n12-16 lakh rupees 15 per cent \\n16-20 lakh rupees 20 per cent \\n20- 24 lakh rupees 25 per cent \\nAbove 24 lakh rupees 30 per cent'),\n",

To tax payers upto ` 12 lakh of normal income (other than special rate \\nincome such as capital gains ) tax rebate is being provided in addition to the \\nbenefit due to slab rate reduction in such a manner that there is no tax payable \\nby them. The total tax benefit of slab rate changes and rebate at different \\nincome levels can be illustrated with examples. A tax payer in the new regime \\nwith an income of ` 12 lakh will get a benefit of ` 80,000 in tax (which is 100% \\nof tax payable as per existing rates). A person having income of ` 18 lakh will \\nget a benefit of ` 70,000 in tax (30% of tax payable as per existing rates).  \\nA person with an income of ` 25 lakh gets a benefit of ` 1,10,000 (25% of his \\ntax payable as per existing rates). \\n160. Details of my tax proposals are given in the Annexure. \\n161. As a result of these proposals, revenue of about ₹ 1 lakh crore in direct \\ntaxes and ₹ 2600 crore in indirect taxes will be forgone.  \\nMr. Speaker Sir, with this, I commend the budget to this august House.  \\nJai Hind.'),\n",
